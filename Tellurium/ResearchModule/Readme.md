# Research Module Overview

## Overview
The Research Module within the Tellerium Library serves as an advanced feature designed to autonomously gather and synthesize information from external sources, thereby enhancing the library's understanding and execution of tasks derived from user commands. This module is particularly crucial when the system encounters scenarios where its existing knowledge base is insufficient to accurately interpret or execute a command.

This is step 8 of the processing.

When the system encounters scenarios where its existing knowledge base is insufficient to interpret or execute a command accurately, the AI-Powered Research Module is activated. This module autonomously gathers and synthesizes information from external sources (like the web or other data sources) to fill knowledge gaps. The system employs ML algorithms to learn from this new information, continuously improving its ability to understand and execute future commands.

## Key Functions
Information Gathering: The module actively searches the web and other data sources to find relevant information that can fill knowledge gaps identified during task processing.
Context Enhancement: It enhances the system's context understanding by providing additional background or details, enabling more informed decision-making and task execution.
Continuous Learning: By incorporating new information into the system, the Research Module contributes to the library's ability to learn and adapt over time, improving its future responses and actions.

## Core Capabilities
Automated Web Scraping: Utilizes web scraping tools to extract data and information from specified web pages, ensuring access to a wide range of online resources.
API Interactions: Engages with various APIs to fetch data from external services, databases, and other information repositories, broadening the scope of accessible knowledge.
Data Processing and Summarization: Applies NLP techniques to process and summarize the gathered information, making it digestible and actionable for the system.

## Workflow
Trigger: The module is activated when other components, like the NLU or Command Structuring Modules, identify a need for additional information or clarification to proceed with a task.
Research: It formulates queries based on the identified gaps and employs web scraping and API calls to gather relevant information.
Analysis and Summarization: The collected data is processed, analyzed, and summarized into a format that the system can utilize.
Integration: The synthesized information is fed back into the system, enhancing the execution of the current task or enriching the system's knowledge base for future tasks.

## Software
- **Inputs**: Queries or topics derived from user commands or system queries that require additional information or context.
Feedback from other modules indicating a lack of information or understanding necessary to complete a task.

- **Outputs**:Relevant information, data, or context gathered from external sources that can be utilized to inform task execution or improve system understanding.
Summarized or processed information ready to be integrated into the system's decision-making process.

- **Interactions**: With NLU and Command Structuring Modules: When these modules encounter ambiguous or incomplete commands that cannot be executed due to a lack of context or understanding, they can trigger the Research Module to seek additional information.
With Dialogue Management Module: The Research Module can provide information necessary for generating more informed and contextually relevant responses during user interactions.
With Learning Feedback Module: Research findings can be used to address gaps identified through user feedback, contributing to the system's continuous learning and adaptation.

- **Library Dependencies**: Web Scraping Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium for programmatically navigating the web, accessing, and extracting data from various sources.
API Interaction Libraries: Requests or HTTPx for interacting with external APIs, including search engines, databases, and other information services.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries: spaCy or NLTK for processing and understanding the text data gathered during the research process, extracting relevant information, and summarizing content.

- **Large Language Models (LLMs) Libraries**: Integration with models like GPT-3 or BERT from Hugging Face's Transformers for generating queries, interpreting search results, and summarizing information in a contextually relevant manner.
Machine Learning Libraries for Text Summarization: TensorFlow or PyTorch, alongside models designed for summarization tasks, to distill the gathered information into concise, actionable insights.
