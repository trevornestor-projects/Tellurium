# Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Module

## Overview
The Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Module is a foundational component of our system, designed to interpret and make sense of user inputs in natural language. By analyzing text, the module extracts meaningful information such as intents, entities, and sentiments, enabling the system to respond accurately and effectively to user requests.

This is step one of the processing.

When a user provides a command in natural language, the Tellerium Library first processes this input through its NLU module. This module analyzes the text to extract meaningful information, such as the user's intent and any relevant entities (names, dates, locations, etc.). For example, if a user says, "Schedule a meeting with John on Friday at 10 AM," the NLU module identifies "schedule a meeting" as the intent, "John" as an entity representing a person, "Friday" as a date, and "10 AM" as a time.

## Key Features
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the user's intention behind a given text input, categorizing it into predefined intent classes.
- **Entity Extraction**: Extracts relevant pieces of information, such as names, dates, locations, and other specifics from the user input.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment expressed in the user input, aiding in contextual understanding and response generation.
- **Context Handling**: Maintains and utilizes conversational context to enhance understanding and accuracy in ongoing dialogues.
- **Language Support**: Capable of processing multiple languages, making the system accessible to a broader user base.

## Software
-**Inputs**: User's natural language commands or text.

-**Outputs**: Structured data representing the intent and entities extracted from the input text.
Interactions: Provides intent and entities to the Intent Recognition Module and the Command Structuring Module. May also interact with the Dialogue Management Module if clarification is needed.

-**Library Dependencies**: 
NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK, HuggingFace Transformers, or Stanford NLP for basic language processing.
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow or PyTorch for custom intent recognition models.
Pre-trained Models: Hugging Face's Transformers for leveraging pre-trained NLU models.
