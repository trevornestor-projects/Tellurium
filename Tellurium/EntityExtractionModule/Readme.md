# Entity Extraction Module

## Overview
The Entity Extraction Module is a specialized component designed to identify and classify named entities within natural language inputs. This module plays a vital role in understanding user commands by extracting pertinent information such as product names, dates, locations, and other relevant entities that are crucial for task execution.

This is step 3 of the processing.

## Key Features
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Accurately identifies named entities within text, such as names, places, dates, and more.
- **Entity Classification**: Classifies entities into predefined categories, facilitating their use in task-specific actions.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Understands the context in which entities appear to improve accuracy and relevance.
- **Custom Entity Models**: Supports the creation and integration of custom entity models tailored to specific domain needs.
- **Integration with NLU**: Seamlessly works with the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module to enhance overall command interpretation.

## Software
- **Inputs**: Text data from the user's natural language commands or inputs, which have already been processed by the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) Module to some extent.

- **Outputs**: A set of entities extracted from the text, each labeled with a category (such as name, date, location, numerical values, etc.). These entities are crucial for understanding the specifics of the user's commands and for structuring actionable tasks.

- **Interactions**: With NLU Module: Receives pre-processed text input for further analysis. The NLU Module might provide contextual clues or partially processed data that can aid in more accurate entity extraction.
With Command Structuring Module: Provides extracted entities that are used to fill in the parameters needed for actionable commands. For example, if the user command is to "schedule a meeting with John on July 5th", the entities "John" (as a contact) and "July 5th" (as a date) are crucial for creating a calendar event.
With Dialogue Management Module: In cases where the entity extraction is uncertain or incomplete, the Dialogue Management Module may initiate a follow-up dialogue with the user to clarify or gather more information, which then gets fed back into the Entity Extraction Module for re-analysis.

- **Library Dependencies**:
NLP Libraries: Libraries like spaCy and Stanford NLP offer robust entity recognition capabilities that can be utilized for extracting entities from text. spaCy, in particular, provides pre-trained models for various languages that can recognize a wide range of entity types.
Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used for developing custom entity extraction models, especially if the domain requires recognizing specialized entities that aren't covered by general-purpose NLP models.
Pre-trained Models: Utilizing models from Hugging Face's Transformers library can be beneficial, especially for leveraging state-of-the-art language models like BERT, GPT, or their variants that have been fine-tuned for entity recognition tasks.
Data Annotation Tools: Tools like Prodigy (by the makers of spaCy) can be useful for creating and managing training datasets for custom entity models, especially when dealing with domain-specific entities that require manual annotation.
