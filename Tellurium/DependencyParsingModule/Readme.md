# Dependency Parsing Module

## Overview
The Dependency Parsing Module is a crucial component of our natural language processing pipeline, designed to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences to understand the relationships between words. This module helps in mapping the syntactic structure of sentences, which is vital for accurately interpreting user commands and converting them into structured actions.

This is step 4 of the processing.

## Features
- **Syntactic Analysis**: Breaks down sentences into their grammatical components, identifying subjects, verbs, objects, and other parts of speech.
- **Dependency Graph Construction**: Builds a graph that represents the dependencies between words, indicating how words in a sentence relate to each other.
- **Relationship Identification**: Determines the roles that words play in relation to one another, crucial for understanding the meaning of user inputs.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Enhances the interpretation of sentences by considering the context within which words are used, improving the accuracy of command structuring.

## Software
- **Inputs**: Raw text from the user's command.

- **Outputs**: Grammatical structure of the sentence, including dependency relationships between words.

- **Interactions**: Outputs are used by the Command Structuring Module to understand command context and structure.

- **Library Dependencies**:
NLP Libraries: spaCy or Stanford NLP for dependency parsing and grammatical analysis.
