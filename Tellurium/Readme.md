# Tellerium Library by CEO of Dreamscape Systems, Trevor Nestor

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a library designed to replace or augment a lot of the functionality of Selenium for automating tasks in web browsers and on computers, leveraging user's natural language inputs rather than require specific domain knowledge of HTML or embedded UI elements and objects. The core idea is that instead of meticulously programming in automation requests which is a requirement with libraries like Selenium, to utilize machine vision for recognizing screen elements and objects, and intelligently navigating the keyboard and mouse to perform a wide range of tasks, both within browsers and in desktop environments, for annoying tasks like repetitive web forms which add little to no value or for testing of applications on the web, mobile, or on a desktop.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand and interpret user commands provided in natural language.
- **Machine Vision**: Identify and interact with GUI elements based on visual cues, enabling automation in a variety of applications.
- **Task Automation**: Perform complex sequences of actions in web browsers and desktop applications, driven by user instructions using the keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals rather than just using terminal commands or code.
- **AI-Powered Research**: Use machine learning and AI, including integration with tools like Bard, ChatGPT, and other Large Language Models (LLMs), to research and determine the best approach to execute user commands.
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Employ AI and ML algorithms to continuously learn and improve the system's responses to user feedback, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automated tasks.

## Objective
The primary goal is to create a versatile and intelligent automation library that goes beyond traditional browser and computer automation by:
- Incorporating advanced AI and ML techniques to interpret and execute tasks based on natural language inputs.
- Utilizing machine vision to interact with both web-based and desktop applications dynamically rather than having to find and rely on running specific commands when information like specific UI element names are not know.
- Enabling the system to conduct independent research to fill knowledge gaps, formulate queries for LLMs or search engines, and refine its operation based on real-time feedback.
