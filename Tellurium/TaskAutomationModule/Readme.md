# Task Automate Module

## Overview
With the system now capable of understanding and researching commands, this module will execute the automated tasks based on the structured commands and machine vision outputs.

This is step 9 of the processing.

The Task Automation Module is a core component of the Tellerium Library, designed to execute a wide range of automation tasks within web browsers and desktop applications. This module translates structured commands and visual cues into dynamic interactions with GUI elements such as mouse movements, clicks, typing, and other functions. Leveraging the information provided by the Machine Vision Module regarding the locations and types of UI elements, the Task Automation Module coordinates precise interactions with these elements, facilitating seamless automation of repetitive or complex tasks based on user commands.

## Key Features
- **Receiving Commands**: Accepts structured commands along with the identified GUI elements' locations and descriptors.

- **Action Planning**: Determines the sequence of actions (clicks, typing, navigation) required to fulfill the structured commands.

- **Dynamic Interaction**: Utilizes the coordinates of GUI elements to dynamically navigate the mouse pointer to these locations. It then performs the designated actions, such as clicking buttons, typing in text fields, or navigating through menus.

- **Adaptive Execution**: Adjusts the execution strategy in real-time based on the success or failure of actions, leveraging feedback mechanisms to ensure task completion.

- **Feedback Loop**: Provides detailed feedback on the execution of actions, including any errors or exceptions encountered, which can be used for debugging and refining the automation tasks.

## Software
- **Inputs**
Structured Commands: Detailed instructions derived from user commands, processed by the NLU, Intent Recognition, and Command Structuring Modules, indicating the actions to be performed.
Element Locations and Descriptors: Information from the Machine Vision Module containing coordinates and descriptors of GUI elements (e.g., buttons, text fields, dropdown menus) identified on the screen.

- **Outputs**
Action Status: Feedback on the execution status of each action (e.g., success, failure, in progress).
Result Data: Any data retrieved or generated as a result of the executed actions, such as confirmation messages, extracted text, or screenshots.

- **Interactions**
With Machine Vision Module: Retrieves the coordinates and descriptors of GUI elements to interact with, ensuring actions are targeted accurately.
With Integration Planning Module: Coordinates the sequence and timing of actions, ensuring they are executed in the correct order and context.
With Dialogue Management Module: In cases where actions require further user input or confirmation, coordinates with this module to manage user interaction.

- **Library Dependencies**
GUI Automation Libraries: Libraries such as PyAutoGUI or Selenium for simulating mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard inputs.
Computer Vision Libraries: Utilize OpenCV for additional image-based analyses if needed, supplementing the Machine Vision Module's outputs.
Utility Libraries: Pillow (PIL) for image manipulation tasks, such as capturing screenshots or processing images for visual feedback.
