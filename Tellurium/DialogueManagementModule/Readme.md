# Dialogue Management Module

## Overview
The Dialogue Management Module orchestrates the conversation between the user and the system, ensuring a seamless and contextually aware interaction. It maintains the dialogue state, interprets user intentions, and generates appropriate system responses, guiding the conversation towards effective resolution of the user's requests.

This is step 5 of the processing.

## Key Features
- **Context Management**: Keeps track of the conversation context, including past interactions and user preferences, to provide relevant responses.
- **Intent Resolution**: Works closely with the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module to clarify and confirm user intents when ambiguities arise.
- **Response Generation**: Leverages predefined templates and dynamic content generation to construct meaningful responses based on the dialogue state and user inputs.
- **Conversation Flow Control**: Manages the progression of the dialogue, handling transitions, branching, and termination of conversations gracefully.
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporates user feedback to refine response strategies and improve conversation quality over time.

## Software
- **Inputs**: User inputs, system state, and context from previous interactions.
Outputs: Responses to the user to manage the dialogue, clarify intents, or gather additional information.

- **Interactions**: Interacts with the NLU Module to process user responses and with the Command Structuring Module to refine commands.

- **Library Dependencies**:
Dialogue Management Frameworks: Rasa or DeepPavlov for managing conversational state and flow.
Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech Recognition Libraries: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text for voice-enabled interfaces.
