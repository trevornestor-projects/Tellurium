# Machine Vision Module

## Overview
The Machine Vision Module in the Tellerium Library is a specialized component designed exclusively for the identification and localization of GUI elements within web browsers and desktop applications. Its primary function is to facilitate the automation of user interactions by pinpointing precise locations for mouse movements and determining the appropriate actions (click, double-click, right-click, etc.) for each identified element. This module employs advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to recognize buttons, icons, links, form fields, and other interactive elements on the screen, enabling users to automate tasks using natural language commands without needing detailed knowledge of the application's underlying structure.

This is step 6 of the processing.

## Key Features
GUI Element Identification: Detects and classifies various GUI elements such as buttons, text fields, dropdown menus, and checkboxes, providing a foundation for interaction automation.
Location and Interaction Mapping: Determines the exact screen coordinates of identified GUI elements and suggests appropriate interaction mechanisms (e.g., click, type, select).
Text Extraction: Utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to identify text within GUI elements, aiding in the recognition of labels, buttons, and instructions on the screen.
Action Suggestion: Analyzes identified elements to suggest possible actions, enhancing the automation's context-awareness and adaptability to different interfaces.
Screen and Context Analysis: Performs comprehensive screen analysis to understand the layout and context of the application interface, ensuring that automation tasks are executed in a contextually relevant manner.

## Software
- **Inputs**
Screen Images: The module takes screenshots or images of the current screen or application window as input to analyze and identify GUI elements.
Element Descriptors: Natural language descriptions or keywords that describe the GUI elements to be identified (e.g., "submit button", "search field").
Area Specifications: Coordinates or regions of interest on the screen for focused analysis, specified as (x, y, width, height).

- **Outputs**
Element Locations: Coordinates of identified GUI elements, typically returned as tuples (x, y) representing the screen position where interactions should occur.
Interaction Types: Suggested types of interactions for each identified element (e.g., click, double-click, enter text).
Extracted Text: Text extracted from GUI elements or specified screen regions using OCR technology.
Action Recommendations: List of possible actions for each identified GUI element, based on the element's type and context.
Interactions
With Command Structuring Module: Provides identified elements and suggested actions to construct structured commands for automation tasks.
With NLU Module: Receives descriptors or keywords in natural language to identify specific GUI elements based on user commands.
With Integration Planning Module: Coordinates with this module to ensure the correct sequence and execution of interactions with GUI elements, based on the broader context of the task being automated.

- **Library Dependencies**
Computer Vision Libraries:
OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks, including element detection, image transformations, and feature extraction.
Pillow (PIL): For handling image file operations, including opening, manipulating, and saving images in various formats.
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Libraries:
Tesseract OCR: An open-source OCR engine used to extract text from images, crucial for reading labels, buttons, and instructions within GUI elements.
Machine Learning Libraries:
TensorFlow or PyTorch: These libraries may be used for developing and deploying custom machine learning models for more advanced element recognition tasks, especially if pre-trained models are applied or fine-tuning is required.
GUI Automation Libraries:
PyAutoGUI: For simulating mouse movements and clicks based on the identified coordinates of GUI elements.
