# Intent Recognition Module

## Overview
The Intent Recognition Module is a pivotal component of our natural language understanding (NLU) pipeline, designed to accurately discern the underlying intent behind users' natural language inputs. Utilizing advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques, this module categorizes user inputs into predefined intent categories, facilitating appropriate responses and actions.

This is step 2 of the processing.

Following the NLU processing, the Intent Recognition Module categorizes the user's input into predefined intent classes, which helps the system understand what the user wants to do. Simultaneously, the Entity Extraction Module identifies and classifies named entities within the input, providing crucial details needed to execute the task.

## Key Features
- **Intent Classification**: Employs sophisticated machine learning models to classify user inputs into specific intents based on training data.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Takes into account the context of the conversation for more accurate intent recognition.
- **Scalability**: Designed to easily incorporate additional intents as the system's capabilities expand.
- **Integration Ready**: Seamlessly integrates with other modules, such as Entity Extraction and Dialogue Management, to provide a cohesive user experience.
- **Continuous Learning**: Incorporates feedback mechanisms to refine and improve intent recognition accuracy over time.

## Software
- **Inputs**: Structured data from the NLU Module (intents and entities).

- **Outputs**: Classified intents with associated confidence scores.
Interactions: Feeds classified intents into the Command Structuring Module and Dialogue Management Module for further processing.

- **Library Dependencies**:

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn for intent classification models.
Deep Learning Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch for more complex intent recognition models.
